Put services that you want to use in both Angular and Nodejs here.
If some of the models you use have platform specific feature and you still want to share the services using this models,
then:
1. Create an interface for the model you want to use in this commonmodule
2. Put the service in this modules and use the interface to type the models you want to use
3. Create a model on the platform you want to user that inherits from the interface (PlatformModel implements ICommonModel)
4. During runtime you then can use the service with the instances of the platform specific models interchangably
